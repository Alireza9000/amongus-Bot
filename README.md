# Among Us Moderator
Built to mute all the participants present in a specific voice channel in a discord server. Created using Node.js, the GUI console used to mute the participants leverages the discord webhooks and discord.js v12.

## Want to implement it in your own server?
In the index.js file, add your own bot's token and in the console.py file (inside console folder) add your text channel's webhook URL. Also don't forget to add your webhook's name in the gui console.py file. Then all you need to do is to host it on heroku !
